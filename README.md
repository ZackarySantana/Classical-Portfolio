# Resume
Resume is my personal portfolio hosted on <a href="https://www.zackaryjamessantana.com">my website</a>
It also hosts different games and navigates to different websites I have designed and developed.

## Games
The games in this <a href="https://github.com/ZackarySantana/PortfolioGames">repo</a> are designed in to this repo, intended use in the src folder.

## Motivation
I'm really motivated to design and create applications/websites. I love learning new thinks and I pick on stuff fast. I would love for a company to view my repositories and contact me.

<li>- [<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>] - Is the framework of this repo</li>
<li>- [<a href="https://react-redux.js.org/>">Redux</a>] - Used in required repo inside of the games</li>
